Product Owner, Developer 
♣	Seaside Dreams is a start-up company based in Nashua, NH.  The owner needed a website capable of carrying out online sales as well as a brand logo for the company.
♣	As a product owner using agile methodologies, my responsibilities included leading communication between the team and the client as well as between the team and the advisor.  Canva was used in the first two-week sprint to create a company logo.  WordPress and custom CSS were implemented in the remaining two-week sprints to create a website.
♣	While the website is not yet live, the project resulted in a fully-functioning company website with e-commerce capabilities and a completed logo.
